## How to change HTML

Included are two demo HTML-pages, main.html and accesspoint.html. 

### To update the HTML
You need to join all lines in those to one (ctrl-A and then ctrl-J in VSCode), also replace all " with \\".  
**OR** use the htmlString.sh script that does that for you.

Copy/paste the oneliner into one of the variables in the main program.
